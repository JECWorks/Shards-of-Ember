# Shards of Ember - Design Bible

This document is the internal reference for narrative structure, world logic, and systemic design direction.

## Creative Pillars

- Classic high fantasy earnest + hopeful restoration fantasy ("rebuilding light")
- Player growth tied to restoring wisdom, trust, and civic life
- Mechanical progression tied to reclaiming Crown power
- Fair, readable systems with consistent player feedback (no "gotcha" design)

## Core Premise

Ember was a central city ruled by a benevolent king wearing a magical Crown that granted wisdom and sight across the kingdom.

Wealthy Barons conspired (with the King’s corrupted chief advisor), overthrew the King, and shattered the Crown into 6 shards.

Each Baron rules a county around the central Ruins of Ember and hides one shard.

A prophecy foretells an adventurer from a distant land who will gather the shards, rebuild the Crown, and restore Ember.

## World Structure

- Central Ruins of Ember:
  - Endgame region and restoration hub.
  - Visual and systemic restoration advances as shards are returned.
- Outer Ring of Counties:
  - 6 major regions (expandable to 8 if needed later).
  - One county seat + one Baron arc + one dungeon per county.

## Crown-Driven Progression

The Crown is the core progression system.

- Each recovered shard grants a meaningful systemic ability.
- Abilities open routes, dialogue options, puzzle solutions, and safer traversal.
- Progression should feel like restoration of virtues rather than raw stat inflation.

## Late-Game Twist: The Seventh Jewel

The Barons missed a seventh jewel: The Unifying Ember.

- Function: Binds the six shard powers into the true Crown.
- Backstory: The King told his second lieutenant how to remove and hide it to prevent despot rule.
- Current state: The lieutenant survives as an old hermit who tests the player’s worthiness.
- Late game: Hermit reveals final test and general location of a secret final dungeon.

## Worthiness / Anti-Greed System

Hidden Greed tracker governs final-worthiness gating.

- Taking specific high-value luxury loot increases Greed.
- Survival necessities should not be punished.
- Hermit gives repeated subtle warnings.
- If Greed exceeds threshold:
  - Hermit withholds final information, or
  - Final dungeon seal rejects entry.

Fairness rules:

- Multiple warning opportunities.
- Consistent cause/effect logic.
- Transparent thematic messaging.
- No irreversible surprise punishment without prior signals.

## System Direction Notes

- Shards should unlock mechanics, not just numbers.
- County design should align environment, dungeon mechanic, and social consequences.
- Restoration feedback should be visible in world state and NPC behavior.
- Keep narrative state data-driven so branch conditions remain testable.
