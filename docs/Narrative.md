# Shards of Ember - Narrative

This document captures story beats, act structure, and key character arcs.

## Narrative Tone

- Classic high fantasy earnest
- Hopeful restoration fantasy ("rebuilding light")
- Corruption versus stewardship, truth, and civic renewal

## High-Level Story Arc

## Opening Act

- The player arrives as a distant wanderer in a fractured kingdom.
- Ember is in ruins at the center of six hostile or controlled counties.
- Early quests establish daily life under Baron rule and introduce shard rumors.
- Player receives first hints of prophecy and restoration possibility.

## Middle Arc

- Player confronts Barons county by county.
- Each county reveals a different corruption pattern and societal harm.
- Recovering each shard restores a facet of rightful Crown power.
- NPC reactions and world state should gradually shift from fear to hope.

## Late Arc

- Six shards are not enough to complete true restoration.
- The hidden seventh jewel ("The Unifying Ember") becomes the final objective.
- Worthiness tests and Greed consequences determine access to the true ending path.
- Restored Crown re-centers the kingdom around Ember.

## Hermit Arc

- The hermit is the King’s former second lieutenant, living in secrecy.
- Role in story:
  - Confirms missing truth about the seventh jewel.
  - Provides warnings about greed and intent.
  - Tests whether the player seeks restoration, not dominion.
- Delivery style:
  - Early: cryptic guidance and warnings.
  - Mid: clearer criteria tied to behavior.
  - Late: unlocks final trial location if player is worthy.

## Opening Act Beats (Current Draft)

1. Arrival at border settlement under heavy levy and surveillance.
2. First civic injustice witnessed (trade, guard abuse, or ration control).
3. Intro dungeon/crawl that demonstrates blocked-route progression.
4. First meaningful choice around compassion versus expedience.
5. First shard lead set by local ally or old records.

## Narrative Constraints

- Avoid "chosen one" entitlement tone; emphasize earned trust and action.
- Maintain fairness in moral systems through repeated warnings and readable consequences.
- Keep restoration visible in world feedback (NPC dialogue, environment, access).
